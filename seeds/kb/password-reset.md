## Self-Service Password Reset (Recommended)

### Steps:

2. Enter your work email address
3. Choose verification method:
   - **Email verification**: Code sent to alternate email
   - **SMS verification**: Code sent to registered phone
   - **Authenticator app**: Approve notification
4. Enter the verification code
5. Create new password following requirements below
6. Sign in with new password

### Password Requirements:
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- Cannot be your last 12 passwords

## Alternative Methods

### Method 1: Using Company Portal

2. Go to Profile > Security > Change Password
3. Enter current password and new password
4. Save changes

### Method 2: Contact IT Support
If self-service doesn't work:

4. You must change it on first login

### Method 3: Mobile Device

## Troubleshooting

### "Account locked" message
- Too many failed login attempts

### Verification code not received
- Check spam/junk folder
- Ensure phone number is correct

- Try different verification method

### "Password doesn't meet requirements"

## Best Practices

1. **Use a password manager** - Recommended: 1Password, LastPass
2. **Enable MFA** - Adds extra security layer
